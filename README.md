# UGC Express Middleware

Express middleware for user-generated content to embed preview on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Discord, etc.

# But, why?

By default if the shared domain (for instance xboxreplay.net) does not match the media one (gameclipscontent-xxxx.xboxlive.com), the preview (gameclip) may be blocked by the navigator due to the `Same-origin policy` (see: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) or by the platform itself.
